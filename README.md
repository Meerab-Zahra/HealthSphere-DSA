HEALTHSPHERE is a C++-based hospital management system developed using Data Structures and Algorithms with file handling. It manages physicians, patients, appointments, telemedication, and a disease detector chatbot. The physician dashboard uses a Binary Search Tree for efficient record retrieval, while the patient dashboard maintains a queue for admissions and discharges. Users can schedule appointments, and Appointment.h will work only after signing into a Twilio account and setting up the cURL library with the compiler to send confirmation messages. Telemedication allows virtual consultations, and a chatbot helps detect diseases based on symptoms. The system stores data in text files and it runs through a menu-driven interface with input validation for accuracy.
